# Simple-E-commerce-Inventory-Management-System
Developed a simple inventory management system for an e-commerce platform using Java. This system include basic functionalities such as adding, updating and removing products, and checking the available stock. Use GitHub Copilot to assist in generating code for implementing different operations and handling edge cases.

This is a basic implementation of an inventory management system. It uses a HashMap to store the inventory, where the product name is the key and the quantity is the value. The methods 'addProduct', 'updateProduct', 'removeProduct', and 'checkStock' perform the respective operations and provide the necessary output.

You can customize and expand this code as per your requirements. Remember to handle any additional edge cases and input validations based on your specific needs.
